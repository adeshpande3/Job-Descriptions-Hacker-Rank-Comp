# Job-Descriptions-Hacker-Rank-Comp
Hackerrank ML Competition

**UPDATE 4/6/17** Framing this as a supervised learning problem and then using LSTMs didn't really work. All of the weight values became way too big as did the output values, making it pretty much impossible to put a softmax on top of it, and get some actual predictions for the test set. And Hackerrank has a time limit to this contest, so couldn't make any other changes.
